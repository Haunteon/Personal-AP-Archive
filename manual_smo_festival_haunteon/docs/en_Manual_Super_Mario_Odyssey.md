# Manual

## What is a Manual game?
A Manual game is a custom game that you've set an item list and location list for so that any game can be included in a multiworld game. You'll manually mark locations checked, and you'll manually restrict what items you use based on the items you've been sent. 

## Where is the settings page?
The player settings page for this game is located <a href="../player-settings">here</a>. It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Every moon you collect is a check.

Items you can receive are:
- Generic or Kingdom Specific Power Moons
- Multimoons which unlock the next world state of each Kingdom
- Boss Unlocks to fight bosses
- Outfits that unlock Outfit doors
- Ability to Captures specific characters
- Kingdom Unlocks to keep the game more multiworld compatible 

## What is the goal of Manual Super Mario Odyssey Festival?

The goal for this manual is to complete the Festival in Metro Kingdom and collect the multimoon.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

All items listed above can be found in other players worlds, except Multimoons which I placed at their respective bosses

## What if I have items, unlocks, or locations that I'd like to not have randomized?

You can set starting items, and exclude locations.

## How do I install the mod for a Manual game?
You don't. There is no mod. The tasks of marking locations as checked and limiting your items used based on items received is all performed by you (the player) while using the Manual client and its accompanying tracker.
